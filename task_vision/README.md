# Car Damage intensity dataset
### Data-set description 
##### Data-set contains 3 folders containing images describing the intensity of damage (minor, moderate and sever)
00-minor
01-moderate
02-sever


------------
### Task
- Find all possible features (feature selection) from images and evaluate them (with some analysis) to increase the image classification accuracy. We have shared with you only some chunk of data for evaluation purposes.

- One set of approach that can work would be to use depth map as a feature. Similarly experiment with other possible features that can help improve the accuracy. Feel free to use any approach/idea/algorithm that crosses your mind.

- Since the data shared is less, we are not focussing on overall image classification accuracy, however our focus is on feature selection techniques and their impact on overall classification.

### Coding Guidelines

**Mandatory**

*   Write clean code with precise comments wherever necessary
*   There should be one entry-point to run your code (eg. `python run.py` if you are coding in python).
*   Update the requirements.txt with all the packages/libraries used in your code base.


**Preferable**

*   Adhere to proper formatting (eg PEP8 in python)
*   Use proper programming paradigms and optimize your code wherever required.
